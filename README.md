# Surfs Up Analysis
### Challenge 9 - Jupyter Notebook/Python/SQlite
#### Colt Korth
 
### Overview:
The analysis of the data is to help determine if a Surf and Ice Cream Shop would be sustainable year-round in Oahu, Hawaii. The client wanted a focus on temperature data in June and December between the years 2010 and 2017. (All temperatures are in Fahrenheit)
 
### Results:
There are 3 key differences in the Temperature data between June and December.
* The difference in the average temperature is 3.90 degrees. (June = 74.94 | December = 71.04)
* The hottest day between the two months has only a 2 degree difference  (June = 85.00 | December = 83.00).
* The coldest day had a larger difference of 8 degree (June = 64.00 | December = 56.00).

### Summary:
Along with the temperature analysis, further queries were made on the precipitation levels of those months as well. While there are differences between the temperature and precipitation levels between the two months, the differences are minor on the year-round sustainability of the potential shop. In regards to weather, the data shows it to be consistent enough to be sustainable year-round. At this point other factors should be considered such as profit/cost of sales ratios, demand of this type of shop in the area, and nearby competition.
